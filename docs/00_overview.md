# Overview

This project presents a **Smart Dustbin** system designed using an **Arduino UNO**, an **ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04)**, and a **servo motor** to automate the opening and closing of a trash bin lid. The goal is to provide a **touchless, hygienic waste disposal solution** that minimizes human contact with the bin surface.

The ultrasonic sensor detects the presence of a hand or object near the lid by measuring the distance continuously. When an object is detected within a predefined range, the sensor sends data to the Arduino, which then triggers the servo motor to open the lid automatically. After a short delay, the lid closes again.

This project promotes **smart hygiene practices**, reduces the risk of germ transmission, and is ideal for places like homes, hospitals, offices, and public areas. The system is **cost-effective, easy to build**, and can be expanded further by adding features like IoT connectivity or garbage level monitoring.
